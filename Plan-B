I am thinking to make a project on Banking system on Java(applet will be used for forms)
it will be like online banking service provided to customers

the main menu will be like:

  
1. open account(adding file)
  in this the details of the customers will be stored in the form that will be processed and the account no and password for that account
  will be given to the customer(which will be a random no.) user will create username with which he/she can login to his account using that password 

  
  2. profile.
 this will store the details of the customer with his username and password also
 once he logged in successfully 
  the menu will be like:
  1.change username
   to change username
  2.change password
  3.change personal details(address, ph no etc)
  4.personal banking
  under this 
   1.deposit money
   2.withdraw money
   3.money transfer(within this bank only)
   4.balance enquiry
   5.loan request(user will fill the form that will be stored for processing)
   (any others)
   
   this is the basic idea that came into my mind. quite different than the basic file handling projects(adding, deleting, modifying etc)
   any other ammendmets to this can be done to make it more better and efficient.
