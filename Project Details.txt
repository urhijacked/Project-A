Note: Wherever I use ##var## it means you have to use the same name for the variables in order for 
much better syncing of branches of our coding...So that we can easily merge codes without any variable name errors.
If you like to change any of them ...Create an Issue on github and let everyone know.
If you like to add some more variable do the same as above.
(I will be uploading a new file Var Project with the variables name and you modify the variable name and if you want to add
then do mdify this file.(write variables along with its role in the prog)
Constantly update this file with the name of the function you are defining in your program with its detail of its significance
)


The Project is about library management System.
It includes File HAndling Techniques
On the main menu There
has to be 3 options 
1.Book Issuing
2.Book Deposit
3.Administration menu.

First about the 3 option
Administration menu:
It contains 10 options
1. Creating Student Record
2.Displaying all student record
3.Display Specific Student record
4.Modify Student Record
5. Delete a student Record
6. Create a book Record
7.Dispaly all book
8.Display specific book details
9. Modify book details
10. Delete A book details

Focussing on 
1. Create student record with Name, Roll no, Registration No, Branch, Hostel details
##var## st_nam, st_rol, st_reg, st_bra, st_hos

2. Displaying needs to be done in order like below:

#############################Student's Record################################
    Name       Roll no.   Registration No.   Branch      Hostel  	
_____________ __________ _________________ __________ ____________
 Danish	        1305456   46541321315646      CS&E         KP-6
 Sanddy         1316315   54653215131553       EEE  	   KP-9

I think you get the idea


Note: It might be a good idea to provide the options in time of entering the branch and hostel
So that someboday doesnt put Computer Science and Engineering and some does CS&E

3. Displaying Specific record like above but with a single student.

4. Modifying.....you can do it

5. Deleting you can do it

6. Create a Book record with Book id, Book name, author name, Book ISBN no.(Its an international reference no. given to
every book), MRP
##var## bk_id, bk_nam, bk_aut, bk_isb, bk_mrp

7. 8. 9. 10. you know how to do it according to above....,,Go for your instincts





Now coming back to the main menu
1.Book Issue
2.Book  Deposit
3. Admin Menu

Now for 
1.Book Issue and 2.Book Deposit
Its up to you how you do it
Some important points:
a> A student can only issue book if he is in the students record and the book should be too present
in book record.
b> A student can't issue more than one book
c> A student has to pay fine for the book if he returns it after 15 days (You can include the date storing option in the book issuing)
